# Python for Breast Cancer
## Purpose:
Breast Cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world. According to the World-Health Organization (WHO), roughly half of all breast cancers occur in women with no specific risk factors other than sex and age. In the clinic, every patient who gets diagnosed with breast cancer gets series of tests to determine course of treatment. Here I walk through using python for exploratory data analysis and predicitve model creation.
## Data Set:
This dataset of breast cancer patients was obtained from Kaggle.com. It was originally sourced from the SEER Program of the NCI in 2017. They provide information based on cancer statistics. The data set consists of mostly binary features. The exception to these are age, tumor size and survival in months.
